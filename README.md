## Introduction

Shuriken CLI is a **TypeScript-built**, **Inversify-powered**, modular command-line framework designed to help teams build, maintain, and share internal developer tools. Inspired by the precision of ninja tactics, it:

- **Discovers** commands dynamically from your `packages/` folder.
- **Loads** only what you invoke (lazy-loading) for lightning-fast startup.
- **Scaffolds** new packages via a single helper script.
- **Manages** version migrations out of the box.
- **Logs** with colorful, fun, timestamped prefixes.

This means your organization can consolidate all custom CLIs into one repo, define package-level commands, and keep everything maintainable.

---

## Why Shuriken? Problems It Solves

Many organizations struggle with managing internal CLI tools and packages at scale:

- **Manual Setup Overhead**: Each project often has its own scripts and setup steps, leading to inconsistent development environments and steep onboarding for new team members.
- **Version Drift**: Packages can diverge across repositoriesâ€”one project may use v1.2.0, another v1.3.5â€”making coordinated upgrades and compatibility guarantees difficult.
- **Fragmented Tooling**: When each team builds and maintains separate CLIs or scripts, duplicative effort increases maintenance costs and decreases discoverability.
- **Migration Pain**: Upgrading package versions can involve manual change logs, bespoke migration scripts per repo, and adâ€‘hoc rollback procedures.

**Shuriken CLI** addresses these challenges by consolidating all custom tooling into a single, modular framework. You can scaffold new packages, run consistent setup steps, apply version migrations programmatically, and share commands across projectsâ€”all with a unified developer experience.

## Features

| Feature                     | Description                                                                                     |
| --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Modular Architecture**    | Place any number of packages under `packages/`â€”Shuriken auto-discovers them.                    |
| **Lazy Command Loading**    | Only the commands you call are loaded into memory, minimizing startup delay.                    |
| **Builtâ€‘in Setup & Update** | Core `setup` and `update` commands for installing, configuring, and migrating package versions. |
| **Scaffolding Helper**      | `prepare-package` script bootstraps a new package template with best-practice boilerplate.      |
| **Custom Commands**         | Define additional commands per package (e.g., `component`, `publish`, `deploy`).                |
| **Configurable Logging**    | Ninjaâ€‘themed logs with color, timestamps, and fun prefixes.                                     |
| **Pluggable Migrations**    | Author migration scripts under `packages/<pkg>/migrations` for version upgrades.                |

---

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js v14+** (we recommend LTS)
- **pnpm** or npm installed globally
- Git (for cloning and version control)

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/soheilnikroo/shuriken
   cd shuriken
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   # or npm install
   ```

3. **Make `shuriken` globally available**

   ```bash
   pnpm link
   # or npm link
   ```

4. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   shuriken --version
   ```

---

## Bootstrapping New Packages

Shuriken includes a helper script to scaffold new packages:

```bash
pnpm run prepare-package
```

You will be prompted for:

- **Package name** (e.g., `my-tools`)
- **Display name**
- **Description**
- **Initial version** (default: `1.0.0`)

On completion, a new folder `packages/<package-name>/` is created with:

```
packages/<package-name>/
â”œâ”€â”€ commands/       # Add your command implementations here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ .gitkeep
â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/     # Write version migration scripts
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ 1.0.0.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ core/           # Optional utilities (logger, fs, process)
â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts        # Exports package metadata, commands, migrations
â””â”€â”€ setup.ts        # Core setup command definition
```

You can then:

```bash
shuriken <package-name> setup
```

---

## Directory Structure

```
root/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/           # All custom packages live here
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ <pkg>/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ commands/   # Custom command files
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ migrations/ # Version upgrade scripts
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ core/       # Shared utilities for this package
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ index.ts    # Package definition
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ setup.ts    # Setup command
â”œâ”€â”€ scripts/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ prepare-package.ts
â”œâ”€â”€ src/                # Core CLI implementation
â”œâ”€â”€ package.json        # Defines build, prepare-package, etc.
â”œâ”€â”€ tsconfig.json       # Paths configured for `@/` and `@packages/`
â””â”€â”€ README.md           # This document
```

## Usage

### Global Help

```bash
shuriken help
```

Lists every package and its commands. Example output:

```

...etc.
```

### Package Commands

Each package exposes commands under `shuriken <package> <command>`.

| Syntax                                  | Description                                  |
| --------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| `shuriken <pkg> setup [--pkg-version]`  | Install/configure package (optional version) |
| `shuriken <pkg> update [--version]`     | Run migrations up to latest or specified     |
| `shuriken <pkg> <custom-cmd> [options]` | Any extra commands defined by the package    |

#### Inspecting Command Details

Use `-h` or `help` to see flags and options:

```bash
shuriken <pkg> <command> -h
# or
shuriken help <command>
```

## Managing Your Company CLI

Turn this project into your orgâ€™s official CLI:

1. **Clone & link locally**
2. **Scaffold packages** via `prepare-package` or by hand
3. **Define commands** in each packageâ€™s `commands/` folder
4. **Push changes** to your internal repo or registry

Teams can then install via npm or link to consume the CLI.

---

## Extending Shuriken

1. **Add a new package** under `packages/` (or use scaffolding).

2. Export an `IPackageDefinition` in `index.ts`:

   ```ts
   import { IPackageDefinition } from '@/types';
   import setupCmd from './setup';
   import myCmd from './commands/my-cmd';
   import { migrations } from './migrations';

   const pkg: IPackageDefinition = {
     metadata: { name: 'my-tools', version: '1.0.0', description: 'My custom tools' },
     commands: [setupCmd, myCmd],
     migrations,
   };
   export default pkg;
   ```

3. Implement commands by adhering to `ICommandDefinition`.

4. Write migration scripts implementing `IMigrationDefinition`.

## Advanced Topics

### Logging

Shurikenâ€™s `Logger` supports:

- **Levels**: debug, info, warn, error, fatal
- **Fun prefixes**: randomized ninja phrases
- **Timestamps**: ISOâ€‘formatted
- **Color output**: optional

### Migrations

Place files under `packages/<pkg>/migrations` named `<semver>.ts`. They will be executed in ascending order when running `shuriken <pkg> update`.

### Debugging

- Increase verbosity: `--logLevel debug`
- Inspect registry: `~/.shuriken/registry.json`
